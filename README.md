Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) for Pacific hake

To use this package, you must have [Rtools 4](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) installed to allow compilation of the Estimation Model which is coded in C++ using the [TMB](https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp) package.

To get started, clone or download this repository and the [companion project](https://github.com/pacific-hake/runhakemse) which contains the calls to the package functions necessary for running the MSE and plotting the results.
