Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) for Pacific hake

To install this package, run the following code. You need to have [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) installed to allow compilation of the
estimation model which is coded in C++ using the [TMB](https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp) package.

```r
devtools::install_github("pacific-hake/pacifichakemse")
```

To get started, clone or download the [companion project](https://github.com/pacific-hake/runhakemse) which contains the calls to the package functions necessary for running the MSE and plotting the results.

## Operating model
The MSE runs with a spatial operating model and the estimation model used in the hake assessment using the file run_MSE_all.R
The file runs six hake management strategy evaluations, with 3 different harvest control rules, and 3 different movement rates. 
## Hake stock assessment
Besides the MSE, the repository also contains the hake stock assessment rewritten in TMB.
