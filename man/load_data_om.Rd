\arguments{
\item{ss_model}{A model input/output list representing the SS model as returned from
\code{\link[=load_ss_model_from_rds]{load_ss_model_from_rds()}}}

\item{n_sim_yrs}{Number of years to be simulated. This is used to set up arrays dimensions
to include simulations so that arrays don't have to be redimensioned in the MSE loop code}

\item{n_season}{Number of seasons}

\item{season_names}{A vector of names for the seasons. Length must equal \code{n_season}}

\item{n_space}{Number of spatial areas}

\item{space_names}{A vector of names for the spaces. Length must equal \code{n_space}}

\item{n_survey}{Survey frequency}

\item{s_yr}{First year of historical simulations}

\item{m_yr}{Last year of historical simulations}

\item{ages}{A vector of ages}

\item{age_names}{A vector of names for the ages. Length must equal length of \code{ages}}

\item{rdev_sd}{Recruitment deviation Standard deviation}

\item{move_init}{Initial distribution of fish}

\item{move_max_init}{Maximum movement rate}

\item{move_fifty_init}{Age at 50 percent maximum movement rate}

\item{move_out}{Fraction of individuals that travel south in the last season}

\item{move_south}{Fraction of individuals that move south during the year}

\item{move_slope}{Slope of the movement function}

\item{ages_no_move}{Ages of fish which do not move in the movement model}

\item{selectivity_change}{Should selectivity change?}

\item{s_min}{Minimum age in fishery selectivity}

\item{s_max}{Maximum age in fishery selectivity}

\item{s_min_survey}{Minimum age in survey selectivity}

\item{s_max_survey}{Maximum age in survey selectivity}

\item{b_future}{Bias adjustment in the future}

\item{yr_future}{How many years into the future should there be stochastic values}

\item{sel_change_yr}{A year in which a selectivity change took place}

\item{sel_hist}{Use historical selectivity?}

\item{f_space}{The proportion of TAC given to each country. First value is Canada,
the second is the US}

\item{log_phi_survey}{Survey phi parameter value}

\item{catch_props_space_season}{Proportion of catch to take by season and space}

\item{...}{Absorb arguments destined for other functions}
